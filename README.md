# supnet
a specification and implementation of a super network

One feature I definitely want: network traffic, from the perspective of the device owner, should be transparent; if you're an admin of a device, you should be able to review encrypted streams, and be able to trace back which applications are using the super network, and what they are saying. Applications running on the device must serve the device owner, for security and device quality of service.
